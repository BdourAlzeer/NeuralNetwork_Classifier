- For the Deep Learning program:
1) if you want to run with 0 hidden layers comment the lines with (One hidden layer & Two hidden layers comments above them) before run
2) if you want to run with 1 hidden layers comment the lines with (0 hidden layer & Two hidden layers comments above them) before run
3) if you want to run with 2 hidden layers comment the lines with (0 hidden layer & One hidden layers comments above them) before run
4) There is also the option to use either ReLu or Sigmoid as Activation functions, so just comment either of them when trying any of them
